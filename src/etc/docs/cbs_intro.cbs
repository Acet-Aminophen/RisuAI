{{// Since we are writing CBS docs in CBS itself, lets use [[]] instead of brackets, so it won't be confused, and lets replace it with brackets when we are done.}}
CBS, formally known as Curly Braced Syntax (CBS, currently only used as "CBS"), is a syntax that is used to write simple macro scripts for Risuai.
It can be used almost any textboxes in Risuai, such as character description, lorebook, regex script, trigger script, and other textboxes.
It can be mixed with plain text, like "[[char]] is a character", or "Hello [[user]]".
It's syntax is like [[char]], or with arguments like [[random::arg1::arg2::arg3]]. it can also be nested like [[random::[[user]]::[[char]]]].
It also has a block syntax, starts with [[#block <A>]] and ends with [[/block]] or simplified [[/]].
