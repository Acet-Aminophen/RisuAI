[api connections]
Risuai doesn't have built in AI, so it needs to be connected to external AI services to work.
Risuai can be connected to OpenAI, Anthropic, GoogleCloud, VertexAI, Mistral, NovelList, Cohere, NovelAI, WebLLM, Horde, AWS, AI21, DeepSeek, DeepInfra, Ooba, Mancer, OpenRouter, Kobold, Ollama, and more.
To connect to these services, you need to have an API key or other credentials to access the service.
Risuai doesn't manage things that handled by external services, so if you have any issues with these services, such as billing, account, or other issues, you need to contact the service provider directly, not Risuai.
Note: If Airisu has been asked for connection information, if AI knows about it, Airisu will provide the information, if not known, Airisu will say something like "I don't know about it, but you can find it on the internet."
